# Image_captioning
 

Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.Here we use Flickr8k datasets that contains 8000 images(6000-training images,1000-test images,1000-validation images) and contains 5 captions for each image.

### Download the datasets:
